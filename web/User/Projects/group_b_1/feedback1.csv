b1,"Skin receptors can also signal movements, what receptors detect skin stretching?",radio,"Ruffini receptors. 
| Joint angle receptor. | Movement receptors.|Proprioceptors.",elaborated,no,a,To detect skin stretching.,
b2,"The Golgi tendon organs are at the | between muscles and |, they signal | imposed on, or generated by, |.",jumbled,junction| tendons | forces | muscles,elaborated,no,a,"The Golgi tendon organs are at the junction between muscles and tendons, they send signals to the brain when muscles contract. They send messages about how much force is being imposed on, or generated by, the muscles.",
b3,Which of the following is the correct explanation of primary sensory endings?,radio,"They wrap around the belly of the fibre in a spiral fashion and react to changes of muscle length and the rate of change (fast adapting). |
They are at the tail endings of the muscle fibre and react to changes of muscle length (slowly adapting). |
They wrap around the head of the fibre in parallel lines and react to changes of muscle length and rate of change (fast adapting).
They are at the tail endings of the muscle fibre and react to the rate of change in muscle length (fast adapting).",non-elaborated,no,b,Primary sensory endings.,
b4,Which of these is a function of joint angle receptors? There may be more than one correct answer.,checkbox,"Least active at extreme angles.|
They are rapidly adapting. |
They are not sensitive in signalling precise joint angles. |
They are not sensitive to extreme angles.",non-elaborated,"yes ",d,NA,
b5,"| muscle spindles are embedded in muscles.
They are innervated by | and | endings 
that respond to changes of |.",jumbled,intrafusal | sensory endings | gamma motor | muscle length,"non elaborated ",no,b,Intrafusal <b class='text-primary'>muscle spindles</b> are embedded in <b class='text-primary'>muscles</b>. They are innervated by <b class='text-primary'>sensory endings</b> and <b class='text-primary'>gamma motor</b> endings that respond to changes of muscle length.,
b6,What innervates the intrafusal fibres to match the muscle length i.e. adjusting the sensitivity of the muscle spindles ?,radio,"Alpha motor fibre. | 
Gamma Motor Neuron. | 
Gamma Motor Fibre. | 
Extrafusal Muscle fibre.",elaborated,"yes ",c,NA,
b7,"The dorsal column medial lemniscal system is an | for touch and proprioception.
 The information is carried via | and eventually ends up in the somatosensory cortex. 
| and | are separated in these ascending pathways.",jumbled,ascending pathway | neurons | Touch | proprioception,elaborated,"yes ",c,NA,
b8,"Secondary sensory endings are |
 and are found at the |
of the muscle fibre and react to changes of muscle |.",jumbled,slow adapting | tail endings | length,non-elaborated,"yes ",d,NA,
