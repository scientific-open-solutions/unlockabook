Glycine,Glycine is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem and spinal chord.,,,,,yes,
List 4 components of a neuron.,"Axon, Cell body, Dendrites, Axon terminals",,,,,,
The dopamine pathway,This neurotransmitter pathway projects through the prefrontal cortex,,,,,,
What is GABA's role in the adult brain?,Set of projection neurons that synthesize and release the neurotransmitter dopamine,,,,,,
list 5 drugs that act on the nucleus accumbens,The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain is GABA which reduce the activity of the neurons to which it binds.,,,,,yes,
"List 8 neuropeptide neurotransmitter examples ","Neurotensin, Somatostatin, Oxytocin, Vasopressin, Bradykinin, Dynorphin, Beta-endorphin, Corticotropin",,,,,yes,
Neuropeptide neurotransmitters and their role,"Unlike small molecule neurotransmitters, neuropeptide neurotransmitters are encoded by specific genes and are synthesised from protein precursors in the cell body.",,,,,,
Stages of a second stage reward neuron,"Second stage reward neurons project from the ventral tegmental area to the Nucleus accumbens and use dopamine as their neurotransmitter, which is a small molecule neurotransmitter",,,,,yes,
Neurotransmitter synthesis and role," A substance is considered a neurotransmitter if it is synthesised in the neuron and is found in the pre synaptic terminus and is released to have an effect on the postsynaptic cell",,,,,,
Norepinephrine,"Norepinephrine spreads anteriorly through the brain forming an extensive net in the cortex. It's roles include learning, memory, anxiety and psychosis.",,,,,yes,
