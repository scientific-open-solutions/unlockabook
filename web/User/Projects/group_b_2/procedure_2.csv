<h3 class='text-primary'>Here's some clarifications about the previous questions:</h3>
<h4>Which of these is NOT a function of joint angle receptors? There are two correct answers.</h4>
<b class=""text-success"">Joint angle receptors are inside the ligaments and joint capsule. They are most sensitive and most active at extreme angles. </b>
<br>
<br>

<h4>What is the function of a Gamma Motor Neuron?<br>
</h4>
<b class=""text-success"">It innovates the intrafusal fibres to match the muscle length.</b>
<br><br>

<h4>The dorsal column medial lemniscal system is an ascending pathway for<b class='text-primary'>?</b> and <b class='text-primary'>?</b>. The information is carried via neurons and eventually ends up in the <b class='text-primary'>?</b>. Touch and proprioception are <b class='text-primary'>?</b> in these ascending pathways.</h4>
<b class=""text-success"">The dorsal column medial lemniscal system is an ascending pathway for touch and proprioception. The information is carried via neurons and eventually ends up in the somatosensory cortex. Touch and proprioception are separated in these ascending pathways.</b>
<br><br>

<h4> <b class='text-primary'>?</b> are slow adapting and are found at the <b class='text-primary'>?</b> of the muscle fibre and react to changes of muscle <b class='text-primary'>?</b>.
</h4>
<b class=""text-success"">Secondary sensory endings are slow adapting and are found at the tail endings of the muscle fibre and react to changes of muscle length and not velocity, thus contributing to a sense of position.</b>
