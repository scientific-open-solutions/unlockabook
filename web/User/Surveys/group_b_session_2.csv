| Joint angle receptor. | Movement receptors.|Proprioceptors.",,no,yes,,
b2,"The Golgi tendon organs are at the | between muscles and |, they signal | imposed on, or generated by, |.",jumbled,Forces|Junction|Muscles|Tendons,,no,,,
b3,Which of the following is the correct explanation of primary sensory endings?,radio,"They wrap around the belly of the fibre in a spiral fashion and react to changes of muscle length and the rate of change (fast adapting). |
They are at the tail endings of the muscle fibre and react to changes of muscle length (slowly adapting). |
They wrap around the head of the fibre in parallel lines and react to changes of muscle length and rate of change (fast adapting).|
They are at the tail endings of the muscle fibre and react to the rate of change in muscle length (fast adapting).",,no,yes,,
b4,Which of these is a function of joint angle receptors? There may be more than one correct answer.,checkbox,"Least active at extreme angles.|
They are rapidly adapting. |
They are not sensitive in signalling precise joint angles. |
