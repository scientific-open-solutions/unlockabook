<h2>Title of Study: How do flashcards help learning?</h2>
<h1>Debrief form </h1>
<br>
Thank you for participating in this study. <br>
<br>
In this project we were interested in how your memory was affected by the types of flashcards you studied. In particular, we were interested in whether images on flashcards and a competitive condition influenced your score on the multiple choice test.<br>
<br>
The study did involve an element of deception. You were told that your performance on the test would be ranked among other participants, however we did not gather any data relating to this. Your perception of competition was what was required for the study.<br>
<br>
This application has been reviewed by the University Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct. <br>
<br>
Thank you, <br>
