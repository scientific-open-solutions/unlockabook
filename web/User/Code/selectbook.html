Which book are you reading


to do
- center the background image
- center the selection of options
- choice of which book
- choice of which chapter
- Harry potter example
  - with magic theme background picture
- send user to phase with the book and chapter information
- no buffering
- no data quality checks at the start
- allow user to upload a upload a spreadsheet from url?
- Advertising for support SOS on the right/top/bottom
- option to download lists onto your app?

- Turn off study functionality?
  - Collector, turn off data quality checks
  - need to switch off the "resume" functionality as if it's an experiment
  
- need to have a multiple choice version as starting point
- and then complete word version to consolidate

- Note that some words might be spoilers, so might need a "spoiler" column

- Need to compare learned words with new words, so the user should have a "learned" word list, right?

- Note that phrases might be appropriate also, not just words

- have a megatable of pairings and how well each user has learned it?
